This is the Nixie pipe clock reated by GORKY with special driver moduel or hv57708pg.
The project file generated by KiCad will be uploaded after all the software and hardware contents are tested and be confirmed to be safe and stable for use.
As planned, it will take at least 6 months for this project to be completed due to my tight schedule and poor ability.
If you have any better solutions, please contact me.

This is a project depend on ESP32-WROVER-E-N16R8, which is a control module with WI-FI and Bluetooth comprised.
In plan, it will use a special designed USB connector on the pcb instead of the outside USB-C connector to avoid the system damage by accident.
